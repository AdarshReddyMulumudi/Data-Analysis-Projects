# Data-Analysis-Projects
Welcome to my Data Analysis Projects repository! This repo contains various data analysis projects where I explore different datasets, apply analytical techniques, and derive insights using tools like Python, R, and SQL. The projects in this repository focus on real-world datasets and provide in-depth analyses of various domains.
#Project Overview
This repository includes multiple data analysis projects that demonstrate different approaches to solving problems using data. Each project aims to answer a set of business or technical questions by processing, cleaning, and analyzing datasets, followed by presenting the findings through visualizations or statistical measures.

#Technologies Used
Python: Used for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn).
Jupyter Notebooks: For interactive code and visualizations.
SQL: For querying and extracting data.
R (optional): For statistical modeling and data visualization.
Tableau/Power BI: For building dashboards and data presentations (if applicable).
Git: For version control.
How to Run the Projects
To run any of the projects locally, follow these steps:

#Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code

Install dependencies: Make sure you have Python installed. You can create a virtual environment and install the required libraries as follows:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open Jupyter Notebook:
